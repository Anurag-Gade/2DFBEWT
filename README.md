# 2D Empirical Wavelet Transform

**Code for the two-dimesnional Empirical Wavelet Transform with fixed-boundary points (FBPs).**

There are various approaches to multiscale analysis, empirical wavelet transform being one. For multiscale analysis of signals, 1-dimension empirical wavelet transform (1DEWT) was introduced and for the analysis of images its two-dimensional counterpart was introduced. However in [1] and [2], two-dimensional empirical wavelet transform was used with **fixed boundary points (FBPs)**. Using frequency points say $f_p$, the FBPs are calculated by using the relation $B_p$ = 2*$\Pi$*f_p/N
